# UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015. They represent a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

There are 17 integrated SDGs, recognizing that actions in one area affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Countries have committed to prioritizing progress for those furthest behind, with the SDGs designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.

Achieving the SDGs requires the creativity, know-how, technology, and financial resources from all sectors of society.
